The concept of sugar crash talks about the fatigue that we feel after we eat tons of sugar, at first there's a spike of energy but then, out of nowhere, that spike falls abruptly into a state of tiredness.

**That also happens with our motivation.**

Last weekend I attended [TEDxOporto](tedxoporto.com/2016/ "TEDxOporto Website") where I spent an entire day hearing amazing stories, exciting lives and motivating people.
As I was hearing those stories I started getting motivated to do something different with my life, to have ideas and conquer all my dreams.

As the day went by I kept telling myself: "Tomorrow you'll start trying".

I wanted to be like one of the speakers, I wanted to have something to talk about, something that inpires other people as much as they inspired me.

I'm sure I wasn't the only one feeling like that. From the 1000 people that attended I'm sure 997 of them left feeling more inspired and motivated, maybe for different reasons than mine, but motivated nonetheless.

## And then the next day arrives.

The next day we fall into reality, we have the sugar crash of motivation. We start telling ourselves "tomorrow I'll start" and we end up doing nothing.
